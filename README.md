Compression Algorithms

Simple and elegant implementations of compression algorithms written in C++.
Includes Huffman, LZ77 and LZw (implemented using a trie data structure).

Done as homework for the "Data Compression and Encryption" course.
All projects have a GUI build with WinForms using C++/CLI, so Visual Studio is needed to compile them.
